My personal homepage that uses Responsive Design techniques on 
every element. It doesn't look like every other website on the 
Internet, I can't help but to think that is a good thing.

A modal example is available in meandlinus.php
An example hero-image used at the top of the pages,
some functionality for this is in the cts.js and cts.css.

An example of media queries for responsive design can be
found in the style in the header of xip.php.
